# ranked_or_not
I often find myself forgetting if I queued for ranked or normal when playing TFT or League, so I made this very simple project, that periodically checks if I'm in game and says if the current game is ranked or not.

## How to run
This app is intended for personal use (it's purpose is too niche so I don't want to deploy it anywhere), but if you want to try it, here's how you can do it:

1. Get an API key from https://developer.riotgames.com
2. Open RankedOrNot.Window.dll.config
3. Paste it to the value of "ApiKey"

4. Fill in the other fields and save the file.
5. Launch RankedOrNot.Window.exe.
6. Start a League of Legends or a TFT game. Now you should know if it's a ranked game or not at all times.
